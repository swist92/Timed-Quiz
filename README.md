# Timed Quiz - Sarah Wist

The goal of this assignment was to create a timed quiz that included specific elements for the user.  The user will click the start button and this will trigger not only the first question to show, but start the timer's countdown, as well.  

As the user chooses the answer, the button click render the next question to appear as well as clear the the previous question's possible answers.  If an answer is incorrect, the user loses ten seconds on the timer.

When all the questions have been answered, the user's score is displayed and the user is prompted to enter their intials.  This is then saved in local storage and can then display the user's high score after cycling through the quiz multiple times.

This assignment requied several JavaScript commands including but not limited to: manipulating the HTML from the DOM, declaring multiple variables, creating an array, a timer, utilizing functions to render the questions and answers, clearing the inner HTML, and utilizing query selectors among other things.

WHen the code executed correctly, the user should have a seamless experience taking the quiz and the creator will have a strong grasp of how JavaScript can be used to create more complex webpages.
